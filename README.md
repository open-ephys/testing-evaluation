testing-evaluation
==================

Code for, and results of evaluations of data quality etc.

We won't have space here to post raw data from tests, but we should collect code for running tests of setups.
Currently this only includes tests of the analog filters on the RHD open-ephys headstages, but there's many other domains of open-ephys for which we should have canonical tests.
